Hello control team! Paul here.
Ready to make a robotic arm? Swag! Lets get going!

## Ideas
* We will use C# becuse it is close to Java and supported with Kinect.
* We will use Microsoft's Kinect tools becuse they are supported.
* We will control the motors using an arduino.
* We will have all the logic on the PC.
* We will use [Firmata](http://playground.arduino.cc/interfacing/firmata) to talk between the PC and the Arduino
	* We will use the included implementation File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata for the 
	* We will use http://code.google.com/p/sharpduino/ for the PC

## Prepare the arduino
*You won't have to do this if someone already has.*

1. Install and run http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software
2. Load File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata onto the Aurduino.
3. Test it.

## How to get coding
1. Install Visual Studio Professional 2012 from https://www.dreamspark.com/
2. Download Kinect tools from MS. http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx
3. Clone!
4. Assign yourself to some issues. Github will work the same way as the FRC code did.
5. Have fun!
